MarDRe
------

MarDRe is a de novo MapReduce-based parallel tool to remove duplicate
DNA reads. Duplicate reads can be seen as identical or nearly identical 
sequences with some mismatches. This tool allows bioinformatics to avoid
the analysis of not necessary reads, reducing the time of subsequent 
procedures with the dataset (e.g., assemblies, mappings, etc.).

This tool is distributed as free software and is publicly available under 
the GPLv3 license at http://mardre.des.udc.es.


Quick User's Guide
------------------

- Prerequisites

1) Make sure you have Java Runtime Environment (JRE) version 1.7 or above

2) Make sure you have a working Hadoop distribution version 2.2 or above

  2.1) HADOOP_HOME environmental variable must be set accordingly

3) Untar the downloaded MarDRe distribution:

  3.1) On Linux/Mac OS, just follow the instructions below:

      $ tar xzf MarDRe-v1.2.tgz

  3.2) Alternatively use your preferred archive extraction tool

4) Set MARDRE_HOME and PATH environmental variables:

  4.1) On Linux/Mac OS you can set them in your profile or your shell 
       configuration files (e.g., .bashrc). Follow the instructions below:

      $ export MARDRE_HOME=/path/to/mardre
      $ export PATH=$MARDRE_HOME/bin:$PATH

- Execution:

The following command removes the duplicates of identical reads (no mismatches)
of a single-end dataset using a prefix length of 15 and 8 reducers:

  $ mardrerun -i dataset.fastq -l 15 -nr 8

The following command shows a similar example but for paired-end computing,
allowing two mismatches and using the default prefix length (20) and 8 reducers:

  $ mardrerun -i dataset1.fastq -p dataset2.fastq -m 2 -nr 8
